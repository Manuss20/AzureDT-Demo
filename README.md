# AzureDT-Demo
In this repository we will collect some examples to be able to demonstrate the capabilities and real application examples of using the Azure Digital Twins service.

## Overview
Azure Digital Twins is a platform as a service (PaaS) offering that enables the creation of knowledge graphs based on digital models of entire environments. These environments could be buildings, factories, farms, energy networks, railways, stadiums, and moreâ€”even entire cities. These digital models can be used to gain insights that drive better products, optimized operations, reduced costs, and breakthrough customer experiences.
