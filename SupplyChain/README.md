# Azure Digital Twins - Demo Supply Chain

## Overview
Azure Digital Twins is a platform as a service (PaaS) offering that enables the creation of knowledge graphs based on digital models of entire environments. These environments could be buildings, factories, farms, energy networks, railways, stadiums, and moreâ€”even entire cities. These digital models can be used to gain insights that drive better products, optimized operations, reduced costs, and breakthrough customer experiences. 

The following demos provide implementation guidance via a standalone demo web app and a developer focused backend sample for users to experiment with.
